<h1>Algorithmic Reading Order 1 Code</h1>

This repository houses the code written during the creation of <a href="https://youtu.be/yHq_WdITkms"> This Video </a>, the first in a series of videos about using graph algorithms to organize a wiki. The videp describes how to parse a WorldAnvil Wiki for articles and links between articles and describes how to make and display a graph using that information.

<h3>Files</h3>

This repository is composed of two Python files: `get_article_info.py` to parse the wiki and `make_graph.py` to make and display the graph.

<h3>Next Video<h3>

In the next video, which can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/nav-5TD5G9M"> here </a>, I discuss how to make a reading order from the graph. To do this, I develop an algorithm similar to Kahn's algorithm that can handle cycles. The code I developed for this can be found here: https://github.com/EricKnocklein/Algorithmic-Reading-Order-2
